- `models/` — GAT and GraphSAGE architectures
- `src/` — Training and evaluation scripts
- `utils/` — Data loaders, metrics, helpers
- `data/` — Add your data here
- `reports/` — Thesis and short report
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for demos

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
